But off late, we have witnessed a contamination of our beloved ambience with an eccentric lifestyle over the past century.\r\nOur insatiable desire to advance at the expense of nature has debilitated our bond with nature.\r\nWe, as students discovered that an issue so fundamental to our existence does not garner the required attention in the formative years of an individual.\r\n\r\nSo, come this February of 2015, as the new year ascends, we relive that divine bond, rejuvenate the surroundings with awareness, repay in full and in care: our attention to mother earth, revise our obligations for a greener world and respire in the festivity of NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
